# bfg Bens Fractal Generator
Fractal Generation Program - Nascent Stages. Built w/ C++ &amp; SFML

This is a project I began building for a school presentation on fractal geometry. 
My topic was later changed to the geometry of music so current development has stalled.

My focus is to create an interactive fractal generator that has several default fractals as well
as a scripting language that allows to create new fractal generation rules on the fly. The language
is tentatibely called bling (Ben's lingo).
